## Books

#### [Blue Like Jazz](https://amzn.to/382lBjM)

Read this years and years ago. My first foray into what other peoples' spiritual lives can look like, and that they can look waaaaay different than my own.

#### [Sapiens](https://amzn.to/35QyV8E)

Very scientific look into the history of humans and why and how religion probably came about in that history. The entire book is super interesting, but the first few chapters are especially pertinent. The chapters on Buddhism and capitalism are also really interesting.

#### [Unapologetic](https://amzn.to/2qWYs1u)

A little hard to read at first because of his British way of writing, but you get used to it eventually. Such a great book and was instrumental in my thinking that the actual _existence_ of God is kind of an irrelevant concern in Christianity. Very empathetic and interesting arguments made. Also contains the most refreshing, genuine story of the gospel I've heard.

#### [Finding God in the Waves](https://amzn.to/2DFpGfv)

Really easy book to read and just chronicles Mike McHargue's (co-host of The Liturgists podcast) journey basically. Provides a lot of insight into _why_ people struggle with faith from a mostly Dawkins-esque viewpoint, and chronicles how he came back to it but it looks different now.

#### [Love Wins](https://amzn.to/381x7eX)

Talks a lot about heaven and hell and whether they were ever really meant to be interpreted as actual places, among other really interesting stuff. It's not _terribly_ thorough, but he makes some really interesting arguments.

#### [Just This](https://amzn.to/37V2O9Q)

Lots of interesting tidbits into the history of Christianity. Provides a completely different paradigm for what it actually means to be a Christian. It's really just meditations on being and our interaction with the world. Not meant to be read straight through. I mainly would just read a couple meditations at a time and try to think about them for a few days.

#### [Traveling Mercies](https://amzn.to/2YaJcKA)

A lot like Blue Like Jazz, this is just Anne Lamott's experience and journey with life and how Christianity weaves into it throughout. Looks very different from conservative, evangelical Christianity and is very intriguing.

#### [Velvet Elvis](https://amzn.to/2Y7HedK)

Same author as Love Wins, this is a fresh take on how we should be thinking about Jesus and Christianity in the modern era. Makes strong arguments for what Jesus meant when he said certain things.

#### [What Is The Bible](https://amzn.to/2OEf4Uu)

Another Rob Bell. Provides a lot of context for passages in the bible and fresh ways to look at them. Really good.

## Videos

[Mike McHargue @ Sandbox Cooperative - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTCHVXnl2s8)

Make sure to stay for the Q&A.

## Music

[David Bazan - Curse Your Branches](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ctAnRgaplxpP5soDM9pPX?si=a2Xkg-IYRzaVwQWFfC8kMg)

The whole album is awesome, but _Hard To Be_ and _When We Fell_ are especially great.
